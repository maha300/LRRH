Plot - 

  *[Opening dialogue cutscene]*Red's mother telling her that she needs to take Gma her meds and a packed dinner because she's ill. She says to go straight there to beat the night and don't stray from the path. Red tries to reason with her mother that it may be too dangerous for her to go alone. Mom dismisses Red's concerns and tells her to just listen and go. Red has a thought bubble that implies that this is typical of her mother. *[Player gains control of Red and may interact with the villagers minimally before going to Gma's house]* Villager interaction will be limited to greetings and scripted baker interaction getting sweets. *[ensures death ending happens first and shows that villagers are interactable]* 
  
  She goes into the forest, which is long path with mostly one path, but with occasional trails that may hold something interesting. When the player tries to go off the path in the first run, Red will put up a thought bubble that will reiterate Mom's advice. *[create sense of curiosity but ensure death scenario and keep focus to main task]* Eventually, Red runs into the wolf who smelled the food she was carrying. She is prompted by the wolf to give him one of her food items [*either packed dinner or baked good will work]*, which he eats and he goes away. *[shows what can attract him, way to avoid him if approached, and possible scheme possibility to poison wolf]* Along the rest of the way through the woods, there may be visual signs that the wolf is following Red.
  
  Red arrives at Gma's, where she's alive and reading in her home. Red slects Gma to talk to her and tells her that she traveled all on her own to deliver what she needs. Gma tells Red that she's a very brave, smart child and is excited to spend the night with her. *[make Gma into maternal figure and build player bond with her to make her death meaningful]* Gma says they should eat the food Red brought and play games. Gma sends Red on a quick fetch quest to grab something outside within the fenced area around the home. **[possibly a food item from a garden or flowers bc ones on table or dead]** Red goes around the house to grab the item, when she heres some kind of crash/thud. When she gets back to the front door, she has a thought bubble wondering if the sound was something entering the house beause she left the door open. *[introduce door shutting idea and outcome]* She enters the house, but Gma is no longer there, but her bedroom door is no ajar. 
  
  *[Death ending cutscene]* When Red enters the bedroom, the classic Wolf-Gma disguise plays out. The wolf has on Gma's cardigan with a bonnet and is sat in her bed to try to look inconspicuous. Red comments of "Gma's" ears, eyes, hands, and teeth. As the wolf says "better to eat you with," Red has caught on to the Wolf and begs to know what he did to her Gma. The wolf sneers and pounces on Red to eat her, revealing blood from also eating Gma. 

  The game goes to black, with text bubbles calling out Red's name. *[New game begins]* The game restarts at the end of Red's introduction conversation with Mom, with Mom asking "are you listening to me?" New converstaion plays out where Red urges her mother that it isn't safe to go on her own. Mom is, again, dismissive and closes the door on Red, reminding her of her advice, which has been proven unhelpful. Red, with a new mission, continues onward.
